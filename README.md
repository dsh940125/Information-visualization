# Visualization

The repository contains some small visualization projects that I did using Python.

### An interative barchart: 
This is an interactive bar-chart that allows users to define the values of interest by clicking in the plot and to see if the value is covered in certain distributions.

### A scatterplot of weather data:
This is a scatterplot that shows the average record low and record high weather data in Arlington, Virginia from 2005 to 2014, and the broken records in 2015.
